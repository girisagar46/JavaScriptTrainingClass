## Questions

**Q1. Want to find out how old you'll be? Calculate it!**

- Store your birth year in a variable.
- Store a future year in a variable.
- Calculate your 2 possible ages for that year based on the stored values.
    For example, if you were born in 1988, then in 2026 you'll be either 37 or 38, depending on what month it is in 2026.
- Output them to the screen like so: "I will be either NN or NN in YYYY", substituting the values. 


**Q2. Calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here.**

- Store a radius into a variable.
- Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".
- Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN". 


**Q3. The Temperature Converter**

- Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
- Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN°C is NN°F".
- Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
- Convert it to celsius and output "NN°F is NN°C." 


**Q4. The Calculator**

- Write a function that will take one argument (a number) and perform the following operations:
    1. Take half of the number and store the result.
    2. Square the result of #1 and store that result.
    3. Calculate the area of a circle with the result of #2 as the radius.
    4. Calculate what percentage that area is of the squared result (#3). 


**Q4. The MixUP**

 Create a function called mixUp. It should take in two strings, and return the concatenation of the two strings (separated by a space) slicing out and swapping the first 2 characters of each. You can assume that the strings are at least 2 characters long. For example:

```js
mixUp('mix', 'pod') // Outputs: 'pox mid'
mixUp('dog', 'dinner') // Outputs:  'dig donner'
```
